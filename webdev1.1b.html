    <br />
    <p>Sisig is often served as an appetizer or pulutan (a dish paired with alcoholic beverages) 
        in Filipino cuisine.<br /> 
        You can also serve it with rice as a main dish if you prefer.<br />
        Adjust the spiciness to your liking by using more or fewer chili peppers.</p>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste<br /></li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> tablespoons oil for sautéing<br /></li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> raw egg (optional, for a creamy texture)<br /></li>

        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro or spring onions (green parts) for garnish</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
    <br />
    <br />
        <li>Start by <u>boiling</u> the pork face, ears, and/or belly in water until tender. <u>Drain</u> and allow it to cool. 
        Once cooled, you can <u>grill</u> the meat until it's slightly crispy, or you can <u>broil</u> it in the oven for a similar effect.
        The goal is to get some char and crispiness on the meat. After <u>grilling</u> or <u>broiling</u>, <u>chop</u> the meat finely and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, <u>heat</u> the oil over medium-high heat. <u>Add</u> the minced garlic and chopped onions.
            <u>Sauté</u> until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><u>Add</u> the chopped grilled pork to the pan. 
            <u>Stir-fry</u> for a few minutes until the meat is heated through and starts to become slightly crispy.</li>
        <li><u>Add</u> the chopped chili peppers and continue to cook for a couple of minutes.
            If you want your sisig to be less spicy, you can remove the seeds from the chili peppers before chopping.</li>
        <li><u>Pour</u> in the soy sauce and calamansi or lime juice. <u>Mix</u> well to distribute the flavors evenly. 
            You can adjust the amount of soy sauce and calamansi/lime juice to your taste.</li>
        <li>If using, <U>crack</U> a raw egg into the pan and quickly <u>stir</u> it into the mixture. 
            This will give the sisig a creamy texture. Continue to cook for another minute or so until the egg is lightly cooked.</li>
        <li><u>Season</u> the sisig with salt and pepper to taste. Keep in mind that soy sauce is already salty, so be cautious with the salt.</li>
        <li>Optional: <u>Drizzle</u> some mayonnaise over the sisig before serving for added creaminess. 
            You can also <u>garnish</u> with chopped cilantro or spring onions.</li>
        <li><u>Serve</u> your pork sisig hot, typically on a sizzling plate if you have one, and enjoy!</li>
