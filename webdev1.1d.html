        Here's a basic recipe for Pork Sinigang, which you can adjust to your taste and dietary preferences</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <br />
    <br />
        <li><strong>1 pound (450g)</strong> pork ribs, pork belly, or pork shoulder, cut into chunks</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> piece of medium-sized red onion,peeled and quartered<br /></li>
        <li><strong>2</strong>medium-sized tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li><strong>2-3</strong> pcs of green chili peppers, optional<br /></li>
        <li><strong>1</strong>medium-sized daikon radish (labanos), peeled and sliced</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong>medium-sized eggplant (talong), sliced</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong>bundle of string beans (sitaw), cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li><strong>2-3</strong>pieces okra, sliced</li>
        <li><strong>4-5</strong>cups of water</li>
        <li><strong>2-3</strong>tablespoons fish sauce (patis), or to taste</li>
        <li><strong>1 packet (about 1.4 oz or 40g)</strong> of sinigang mix (available at Asian grocery stores) or tamarind paste</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

    <br />
    <br />
        <li>Prepare the Pork: In a large pot, combine the pork chunks, onions, tomatoes, and green chili peppers (if using).
            Add water, enough to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and let it cook until the pork is tender 
            (usually about 45 minutes to 1 hour). You can skim off any scum that rises to the surface.</li>
        <li>Tamarind Flavor: Once the pork is tender, add the sinigang mix or tamarind paste. Stir well to dissolve. 
            Adjust the amount to achieve your desired level of sourness. If you're using sinigang mix, follow the package instructions for the right amount.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Add the daikon radish and eggplant to the pot. Simmer for about 5 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Season: Season the soup with fish sauce (patis), salt, and pepper to taste. 
            Remember that sinigang should have a balanced sour and savory flavor, so adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li>Add Remaining Vegetables: Add the string beans and okra to the pot. Continue to simmer until all the vegetables are tender but not overcooked. 
            This usually takes another 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the pot from heat. Taste the sinigang once more and adjust the seasoning if needed. 
            Serve the sinigang hot in bowls, garnished with fresh cilantro or water spinach leaves, and sliced green onions if desired. 
            It's traditionally served with steamed rice.</li>
